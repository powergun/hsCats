# Category Theory and Haskell

(and other languages too)

## Background

In the past I made a few unsuccessful attempts to crack open this
heavy door to the world of the category theory. This project is just 
another attempt. 

## Structure

notebooks: 

notes taken from _Category Theory for Programmers_ book;

jupyter notebooks with concepts and demo implementations; execute `nb`
to launch ihaskell docker container.

hs:

haskell source code; use stack

cc:

c++ source code; use cmake

py:

python source code; use poetry
